## BackTracking
Recursively add each num to temp list and reduce the problem to nums from i + 1 to end   
After the recursive process, remove it and start form next num
## DFS
For each num, we can choose it or not. For choose, add it to every exist lists, for not choose, do nothing(just leave the original results).
